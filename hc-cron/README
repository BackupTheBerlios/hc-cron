*********** WARNING ***** WARNING ***** WARNING **************************

This version is a development release! The stable version of this program is
hc-cron 0.13! Don't expect everything to work without glitches out-of-the-box.
Please report any bugs you encounter or make other suggestions to improve
this program.

**************************************************************************

Does your computer run 24 hours a day? Are you establishing uptime records
that would scare users of other OS's? If so, this program is not for you.
However, if you turn your computer off at least once a day, like the rest of
us, you might find it quite helpful. But even if your computer runs 24/7
this program can come in handy if you need your cron jobs to be executed
reliably independent form down-times due to maintainance or crashes.

This program is a modification of Paul Vixie's cron daemon that is intended
for ``home computers'' i.e. computers that don't run all the time. Basicly
what it does in addition to standard cron behaviour, is to remember the time
when it last ran a job or was shut down. At startup it reads back this
information and looks whether any jobs have occured while it was down. If
so, these are scheduled and executed one every minute.

I hacked this piece of code together because I was annoyed that standard
cron didn't run the jobs regularly on my laptop. The same problem is solved
by anacron (a program from the Debian Linux distribution); however I felt,
that adding yet another program to startup was the wrong approach. So I took
a deep breath, downloaded the sources of vixie-cron (actually the patched
version that is included in RedHat5.0) and tried my best. However, I don't
really feel like my knowledge of C and programming in the UNIX environment
is sufficient for such a project. So I'd be happy if a *real* programmer
could take the code, improve it, make it portable and so on.

That being said, the program works nicely on my computer, however I don't
guarantee it will on yours. If you or your computer take any damage from
running this program (or looking at the source :), I refuse any liability.
My additions to the code are placed under the GNU General Public License
(Version 2 or later), please see the file COPYING for details.
